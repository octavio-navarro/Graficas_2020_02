# A5: Robot Rush

Assignment No 6 for the computer graphics course.

Based on the Class demos, create a 3D [zerg rush](https://elgoog.im/zergrush/) style game: 

- Load a Robot 3D model, with animations, of your choosing to be used as a target.
- The robots spawn at the end of the level, and start moving towards a fixed position where the camera is positioned.
- You have to click the robots to kill them before they reach that point. 
- If you kill a robot, you gain one point. If it gets to the position, you loose one point. In either case, the robot disapears after a while.
- The game must have a score, and a timer. When the timer ends, the game stops and an option to restart is given.
- Spawn only a fixed amount of robots. When one is destroyed, spawn a new one.
- Create a new dead animation for the robot using keyframes.
- Create a simple user interface using html and css that shows the high score, timer and that allow the user to start and restart the game.

**Rubric:**

- The game was created as specified.
- Created a dead animation for the model using keyframes and existing animations.
- The user could interact correctly with the 3D model, and when an interaction happens, the dead animation is played. The model is then erased from the scene after a little while.
- A high score and timer were correctly implemented.
- UI feedback messages (to start or restart the game) were correctly displayed.
