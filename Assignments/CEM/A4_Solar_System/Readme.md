# Assignment 4 SolarSystem

Assignment No 4 for the computer graphics course. Using three.js, create a simple solar system.

**Rubric:**

- Create 8 planets (and pluto), with their respective moons, the sun, and the asteroid field.
- The planets and moons can be created as spheres.
- EXTRA: For the asteroids, and some of the moons, investigate how to load the geometry from an obj or json file.
- Planets and moons must have their own rotation.
- The moons have to rotate around the planets, and the planets have to rotate around the sun.
- Draw the orbit that each planet follows.
- Each element must have its own materials, with textures, and normal or bump maps.
- Most textures can be found here: http://planetpixelemporium.com/
- The panning and rotation of the system has to be controlled using an orbit controller.
- The sun has to have a shader material of your own design. The shader has to have at least two textures that area animated.

**Deadline:** March 19
