# A4: OBJ Rush

Assignment No 4 for the computer graphics course.

Based on the Class demos, create a 3D [zerg rush](https://elgoog.im/zergrush/) style game: 

- Load an OBJ 3D model of your choosing to be used as a target.
- The model has to have textures.
- OBJs spawn at the end of the level, and start moving towards a fixed position where the camera is positioned.
- You have to click the OBJs to kill them before they reach that point. 
- If you kill a OBJ, you gain one point. If the OBJ gets to the position, you loose one point. 
- The game must have a score, and a timer. When the timer ends, the game stops and an option to restart is given.
- Spawn only a fixed amount of OBJs. When a OBJ is destroyed, spawn a new one.

**Rubric:**

- Loaded a 3D OBJ model.
- The game was created as specified.
- The user could interact correctly with the 3D model.
- A high score and timer were correctly implemented.

**Deadline:** 31/03/2020
